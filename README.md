# Breast-Cancer
I did research about the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset by R. I Applied bagging, boosting, and random forests to the
dataset. Fited the models on a training set, and evaluated them on a test set. I found that the boosting is the best way.You can 
get the dataset from R package "MMST" or you can get it from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29
